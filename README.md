# Fraud-Detection-System
This is a Fraud Transaction Detection System Built using Random Forest Classification. It can also be trained using Decision Tree Classification.  In a fraud detection model, Precision is highly important because rather than predicting normal transactions correctly we want Fraud transactions to be predicted correctly and Legit to be left off.
